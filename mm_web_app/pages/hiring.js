        An extremely rare opportunity to join an early stage funded tech-driven startup. Founded by a technical CEO with recent experience raising sizeable funding (USD $15m+) from top tier Silicon Valley VC firms, this venture is backed by investors from Asia and Silicon Valley and has mass-market potential to transform a number of areas online in discovery, sharing and social networks.<br />
        <br />
        The successful candidate will have hands-on responsibility for architecting, refining and “productionizing” maomao’s current server platform for its proof-of-concept product. This is a highly technical role and requires ability to quickly assimilate to complex problem domains in machine-learning/taxonomy/corpus analysis.<br />
        <br />
            Key technical competencies include: DB and API architecture (SQL Server, MySql or similar, C# Entity Framework with heavy emphasis on functional paradigms, Node.JS or similar) including traversing of large semi-structured external datasets (~50 GB) in a robust and performant manner.<br />
        <br />
            The ideal person for this challenging and rewarding role would be based in Oxford, and would help the founders in the built out of a core technical and product team in that location. Compensation model is flexible, and can comprise of monthly pay, stage/bonus payments, and equity in the company. Creative working patterns are possible (and encouraged!) including working from home, and/or working with and potentially from the company’s current base in Asia (Singapore and Vietnam). The first round of screening will consist of substantial technical testing: please do not apply unless all of the skills and platforms above are within your comfort zone.<br />
